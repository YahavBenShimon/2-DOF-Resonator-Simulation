# 2-DOF-Resonator-Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB code to simulate the frequency response behavior of a NEMS (Nanoelectromechanical Systems) torsional resonator with two degrees of freedom (DOF) - angle and displacement.

## Background

NEMS torsional resonators play a pivotal role in modern micro and nanoscale mechanical systems, offering a wide array of applications from sensing to signal processing. This simulation aims to provide insights into the behavior of such resonators under varying conditions.

## Features

- **Real-world Data Integration:** Most system variables have been acquired through meticulous experiments or simulations using COMSOL.
- **2 DOF System Analysis:** The simulation incorporates both angle and displacement degrees of freedom to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the resonator.
- **Frequency Response Behavior:** Get a deep understanding of how the resonator behaves across different frequencies.
